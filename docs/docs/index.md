# AdlerCov

### Powerful code coverage visualization

**AdlerCov** converts coverage reports generated by Cobertura, GoCover or GCov into human-readable reports in various formats.

The reports show the coverage quotas and also visualize which lines of your source code have been covered.

**AdlerCov** supports merging several coverage files into a single report, giving you a unified view of your project's test coverage across different test suites (e.g., unit and integration tests).

Originally a Go port of the excellent [ReportGenerator](https://github.com/danielpalme/ReportGenerator) by Daniel Palme, **AdlerCov** has evolved into something different. Built in Go, it focuses on performance, simplicity, and a clean architecture tailored for today’s development workflows.

## Motivation

[ReportGenerator](https://github.com/danielpalme/ReportGenerator) is a mature and feature-rich tool that has served the .NET ecosystem for over **14 years**. Its robustness and design inspired this project.

The motivations for creating **AdlerCov**:

1.  **For Study:** To explore the architectural challenges of translating a large project to a new language while keeping the result idiomatic and aligned with modern best practices of the target language.
2.  **Dependency-Free:** A lightweight, native binary that runs anywhere without external runtimes—ideal for containers and CI/CD pipelines.
3.  **Modern Extensibility:** Designed with a clean, multi-stage pipeline in Go, enabling rapid extension for new report formats and language-specific analysis.

## Feature Status

While AdlerCov began by mirroring ReportGenerator’s capabilities, it is now diverging with Go-native enhancements and a growing list of planned features.

## Why "AdlerCov"?

The name **AdlerCov** combines **“Adler”** (German for **eagle**) with **coverage**, evoking the image of a high-flying, sharp-eyed bird analyzing your entire codebase. It reflects the project's mission: to help developers detect weaknesses and gaps in their test coverage with clarity and accuracy.

## How to Contribute

This project is actively evolving. Your contributions are highly valued! Whether you're adding new input formats, improving a language processor, or enhancing the documentation, I would love your help.

### System Design

AdlerCov is built around a clean, four-stage pipeline that makes it easy to extend and maintain.

*   **1. Parsing (`internal/parsers`):** Each parser has one job: to translate a specific report format (like Cobertura XML) into a standardized, raw `ParserResult` struct. It extracts line and branch hits but does no further analysis.

*   **2. Tree Building (`internal/tree`):** The `TreeBuilder` takes all the `ParserResult` and merges them into a single, hierarchical `SummaryTree`. This tree mirrors the project's file structure and correctly sums coverage data for files that appear in multiple reports. The tree is still "raw" at this stage with just Line and Branch coverage extracted from the report.

*   **3. Hydration (`internal/hydrator`):** The `Hydrator` takes the raw tree and enriches it. For each file, it reads the source code, uses a `language.Processor` to perform static analysis (like finding method boundaries and calculating cyclomatic complexity), and populates the tree with this rich data.

*   **4. Reporting (`internal/reporter`):** The final, hydrated `SummaryTree` is passed to one or more `Reporter` components. Each reporter is responsible for transforming this complete data model into a user-facing format, like an HTML report or a text summary.

This modular design ensures that each component has a single and clear responsibility.
